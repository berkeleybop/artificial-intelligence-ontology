This is an implementation of multi-headed attention as described in the paper ""Attention is all you Need"" (Vaswani et al., 2017). If query, key, value are the same, then this is self-attention. Each timestep in query attends to the corresponding sequence in key, and returns a fixed-width vector.This layer first projects query, key and value. These are (effectively) a list of tensors of length num_attention_heads, where the corresponding shapes are (batch_size, <query dimensions>, key_dim), (batch_size, <key/value dimensions>, key_dim), (batch_size, <key/value dimensions>, value_dim).Then, the query and key tensors are dot-producted and scaled. These are softmaxed to obtain attention probabilities. The value tensors are then interpolated by these probabilities, then concatenated back to a single tensor. Finally, the result tensor with the last dimension as value_dim can take an linear projection and return.

AIO:DepthwiseConv1DLayer,Layer,AIO:LayerSubset,,,DepthwiseConv1D Layer,0.95,"Depthwise 1D convolution. Depthwise convolution is a type of convolution in which each input channel is convolved with a different kernel (called a depthwise kernel). You can understand depthwise convolution as the first step in a depthwise separable convolution. It is implemented via the following steps: Split the input into individual channels. Convolve each channel with an individual depthwise kernel with depth_multiplier output channels. Concatenate the convolved outputs along the channels axis. Unlike a regular 1D convolution, depthwise convolution does not mix information across different input channels. The depth_multiplier argument determines how many filter are applied to one input channel. As such, it controls the amount of output channels that are generated per input channel in the depthwise step.",A layer that performs depthwise 1D convolution,https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/DepthwiseConv1D,,,,,AIO:ConvolutionalLayer

Importantly, batch normalization works differently during training and during inference. During training (i.e. when using fit() or when calling the layer/model with the argument training=True), the layer normalizes its output using the mean and standard deviation of the current batch of inputs. That is to say, for each channel being normalized, the layer returns gamma * (batch - mean(batch)) / sqrt(var(batch) + epsilon) + beta, where: epsilon is small constant (configurable as part of the constructor arguments), gamma is a learned scaling factor (initialized as 1), which can be disabled by passing scale=False to the constructor. beta is a learned offset factor (initialized as 0), which can be disabled by passing center=False to the constructor. During inference (i.e. when using evaluate() or predict() or when calling the layer/model with the argument training=False (which is the default), the layer normalizes its output using a moving average of the mean and standard deviation of the batches it has seen during training. That is to say, it returns gamma * (batch - self.moving_mean) / sqrt(self.moving_var + epsilon) + beta. self.moving_mean and self.moving_var are non-trainable variables that are updated each time the layer in called in training mode, as such: moving_mean = moving_mean * momentum + mean(batch) * (1 - momentum) moving_var = moving_var * momentum + var(batch) * (1 - momentum).",A normalization layer that normalizes its inputs applying a transformation that maintains the mean close to 0 and the standard deviation close to 1.,https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization,,,,,AIO:NormalizationLayer
