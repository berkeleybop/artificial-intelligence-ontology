# AIO Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for AIO, the Artificial Intelligence Ontology!

AIO is an ontology modeling classes and relationships describing:

* deep learning networks
* their component layers and activation functions
* machine learning methods
* potential biases in AI/ML

You can find descriptions of the standard ontology engineering workflows [here](odk-workflows/index.md).
