An LSM consists of a large collection of units (called nodes, or neurons). Each node receives time varying input from external sources (the inputs) as well as from other nodes. Nodes are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes. The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read out by linear discriminant units. The soup of recurrently connected nodes will end up computing a large variety of nonlinear functions on the input. Given a large enough variety of such nonlinear functions, it is theoretically possible to obtain linear combinations (using the read out units) to perform whatever mathematical operation is needed to perform a certain task, such as speech recognition or computer vision. The word liquid in the name comes from the analogy drawn to dropping a stone into a still body of water or other liquid. The falling stone will generate ripples in the liquid. The input (motion of the falling stone) has been converted into a spatio-temporal pattern of liquid displacement (ripples).

That is to say, for each channel being normalized, the layer returns gamma * (batch - mean(batch)) / sqrt(var(batch) + epsilon) + beta, where: epsilon is small constant (configurable as part of the constructor arguments), gamma is a learned scaling factor (initialized as 1), which can be disabled by passing scale=False to the constructor. beta is a learned offset factor (initialized as 0), which can be disabled by passing center=False to the constructor. During inference (i.e. when using evaluate() or predict() or when calling the layer/model with the argument training=False (which is the default), the layer normalizes its output using a moving average of the mean and standard deviation of the batches it has seen during training. That is to say, it returns gamma * (batch - self.moving_mean) / sqrt(self.moving_var + epsilon) + beta. self.moving_mean and self.moving_var are non-trainable variables that are updated each time the layer in called in training mode, as such: moving_mean = moving_mean * momentum + mean(batch) * (1 - momentum) moving_var = moving_var * momentum + var(batch) * (1 - momentum).",https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization,,AIO:NormalizationLayer

These are softmaxed to obtain attention probabilities. The value tensors are then interpolated by these probabilities, then concatenated back to a single tensor. Finally, the result tensor with the last dimension as value_dim can take an linear projection and return.
