def: "A normalization layer that normalizes its inputs applying a transformation that maintains the mean close to 0 and the standard deviation close to 1." [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization]
comment: Layer that normalizes its inputs. Batch normalization applies a transformation that maintains the mean output close to 0 and the output standard deviation close to 1. Importantly, batch normalization works differently during training and during inference. During training (i.e. when using fit() or when calling the layer/model with the argument training=True), the layer normalizes its output using the mean and standard deviation of the current batch of inputs. That is to say, for each channel being normalized, the layer returns gamma * (batch - mean(batch)) / sqrt(var(batch) + epsilon) + beta, where: epsilon is small constant (configurable as part of the constructor arguments), gamma is a learned scaling factor (initialized as 1), which can be disabled by passing scale=False to the constructor. beta is a learned offset factor (initialized as 0), which can be disabled by passing center=False to the constructor. During inference (i.e. when using evaluate() or predict() or when calling the layer/model with the argument training=False (which is the default), the layer normalizes its output using a moving average of the mean and standard deviation of the batches it has seen during training. That is to say, it returns gamma * (batch - self.moving_mean) / sqrt(self.moving_var + epsilon) + beta. self.moving_mean and self.moving_var are non-trainable variables that are updated each time the layer in called in training mode, as such: moving_mean = moving_mean * momentum + mean(batch) * (1 - momentum) moving_var = moving_var * momentum + var(batch) * (1 - momentum).

comment: Contrastive learning is a self-supervised learning approach in which the model learns to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs of data samples. By maximizing the similarity between positive pairs (similar samples) and minimizing the similarity between negative pairs (dissimilar samples), the model learns to capture meaningful representations of the data. This method is particularly effective for representation learning and is widely used in tasks such as image classification, clustering, and retrieval. Contrastive learning techniques often employ loss functions such as the contrastive loss or the triplet loss to achieve these objectives.

At the first layer of the model, this column oriented data should be converted to a single Tensor. This layer can be called multiple times with different features. This is the V2 version of this layer that uses name_scopes to create variables instead of variable_scopes. But this approach currently lacks support for partitioned variables. In that case, use the V1 version instead.

comment: Depthwise 1D convolution. Depthwise convolution is a type of convolution in which each input channel is convolved with a different kernel (called a depthwise kernel). You can understand depthwise convolution as the first step in a depthwise separable convolution. It is implemented via the following steps: Split the input into individual channels. Convolve each channel with an individual depthwise kernel with depth_multiplier output channels. Concatenate the convolved outputs along the channels axis. Unlike a regular 1D convolution, depthwise convolution does not mix information across different input channels. The depth_multiplier argument determines how many filter are applied to one input channel. As such, it controls the amount of output channels that are generated per input channel in the depthwise step.

def: "A regularization layer that applies Dropout to the input" [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout]
comment: Applies Dropout to the input. The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate) such that the sum over all inputs is unchanged. Note that the Dropout layer only applies when training is set to True such that no values are dropped during inference. When using model.fit, training will be appropriately set to True automatically, and in other contexts, you can set the kwarg explicitly to True when calling the layer. (This is in contrast to setting trainable=False for a Dropout layer. trainable does not affect the layer's behavior, as Dropout does not have any variables/weights that can be frozen during training.)

comment: The exponential linear unit (ELU) with alpha > 0 is: x if x > 0 and alpha * (exp(x) - 1) if x < 0 The ELU hyperparameter alpha controls the value to which an ELU saturates for negative net inputs. ELUs diminish the vanishing gradient effect. ELUs have negative values which pushes the mean of the activations closer to zero. Mean activations that are closer to zero enable faster Learning as they bring the gradient closer to the natural gradient. ELUs saturate to a negative value when the argument gets smaller. Saturation means a small derivative which decreases the variation and the information that is propagated to the next layer.

comment: Gated Recurrent Unit - Cho et al. 2014. Based on available runtime hardware and constraints, this layer will choose different implementations (cuDNN-based or pure-TensorFlow) to maximize the performance. If a GPU is available and all the arguments to the layer meet the requirement of the cuDNN kernel (see below for details), the layer will use a fast cuDNN implementation. The requirements to use the cuDNN implementation are: activation == tanh, recurrent_activation == sigmoid, recurrent_dropout == 0, unroll is False, use_bias is True, reset_after is True. Inputs, if use masking, are strictly right-padded. Eager execution is enabled in the outermost context. There are two variants of the GRU implementation. The default one is based on v3 and has reset gate applied to hidden state before matrix multiplication. The other one is based on original and has the order reversed. The second variant is compatible with CuDNNGRU (GPU-only) and allows inference on CPU. Thus it has separate biases for kernel and recurrent_kernel. To use this variant, set reset_after=True and recurrent_activation='sigmoid'.

It element-wise converts a ints or strings to ints in a fixed range. The stable hash function uses tensorflow::ops::Fingerprint to produce the same output consistently across all platforms. This layer uses FarmHash64 by default, which provides a consistent hashed output across different platforms and is stable across invocations, regardless of device and context, by mixing the input bits thoroughly. If you want to obfuscate the hashed output, you can also pass a random salt argument in the constructor. In that case, the layer will use the SipHash64 hash function, with the salt value serving as additional input to the hash function.

comment: A hidden layer is located between the input and output of the algorithm, in which the function applies weights to the inputs and directs them through an activation function as the output. In short, the hidden layers perform nonlinear transformations of the inputs entered into the network. Hidden layers vary depending on the function of the neural network, and similarly, the layers may vary depending on their associated weights.

Based on available runtime hardware and constraints, this layer will choose different implementations (cuDNN-based or pure-TensorFlow) to maximize the performance. If a GPU is available and all the arguments to the layer meet the requirement of the cuDNN kernel (see below for details), the layer will use a fast cuDNN implementation. The requirements to use the cuDNN implementation are: 1. activation == tanh, 2. recurrent_activation == sigmoid, 3. recurrent_dropout == 0, 4. unroll is False, 5. use_bias is True, 6. Inputs, if use masking, are strictly right-padded, 7. Eager execution is enabled in the outermost context.

comment: This is the class from which all layers inherit. A layer is a callable object that takes as input one or more tensors and that outputs one or more tensors. It involves computation, defined in the call() method, and a state (weight variables). State can be created in various places, at the convenience of the subclass implementer: in __init__(); in the optional build() method, which is invoked by the first __call__() to the layer, and supplies the shape(s) of the input(s), which may not have been known at initialization time; in the first invocation of call(), with some caveats discussed below. Users will just instantiate a layer and then treat it as a callable.

Normalize the activations of the previous layer for each given example in a batch independently, rather than across a batch like Batch Normalization. i.e. applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation within each example close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1. Given a tensor inputs, moments are calculated and normalization is performed across the axes specified in axis.

For each timestep in the input tensor (dimension #1 in the tensor), if all values in the input tensor at that timestep are equal to mask_value, then the timestep will be masked (skipped) in all downstream layers (as long as they support masking). If any downstream layer does not support masking yet receives such an input mask, an exception will be raised.

def: "An attention layer that allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces." [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MultiHeadAttention]
comment: MultiHeadAttention layer. This is an implementation of multi-headed attention as described in the paper "Attention is all you Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017). If query, key, value are the same, then this is self-attention. Each timestep in query attends to the corresponding sequence in key, and returns a fixed-width vector.This layer first projects query, key and value. These are (effectively) a list of tensors of length num_attention_heads, where the corresponding shapes are (batch_size, <query dimensions>, key_dim), (batch_size, <key/value dimensions>, key_dim), (batch_size, <key/value dimensions>, value_dim).Then, the query and key tensors are dot-producted and scaled. These are softmaxed to obtain attention probabilities. The value tensors are then interpolated by these probabilities, then concatenated back to a single tensor. Finally, the result tensor with the last dimension as value_dim can take an linear projection and return. When using MultiHeadAttention inside a custom Layer, the custom Layer must implement build() and call MultiHeadAttention's _build_from_signature(). This enables weights to be restored correctly when the model is loaded.

comment: A preprocessing layer which randomly adjusts contrast during training. This layer will randomly adjust the contrast of an image or images by a random factor. Contrast is adjusted independently for each channel of each image during training. For each channel, this layer computes the mean of the image pixels in the channel and then adjusts each component x of each pixel to (x - mean) * contrast_factor + mean. Input pixel values can be of any range (e.g. [0., 1.) or [0, 255]) and in integer or floating point dtype. By default, the layer will output floats.

Separable convolutions consist of first performing a depthwise spatial convolution (which acts on each input channel separately) followed by a pointwise convolution which mixes the resulting output channels. The depth_multiplier argument controls how many output channels are generated per input channel in the depthwise step. Intuitively, separable convolutions can be understood as a way to factorize a convolution kernel into two smaller kernels, or as an extreme version of an Inception block.

comment: Spatial 1D version of Dropout. This version performs the same function as Dropout, however, it drops entire 1D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent frames within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the activations and will otherwise just result in an effective Learning rate decrease. In this case, SpatialDropout1D will help promote independence between feature maps and should be used instead.
